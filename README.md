# MIRF-Explorer
GUI for opening MIRF files and exploring general headers and individual trace header attribute. Traces can be displayed as individual components or receivers. Surface reference/auxiliary channels can be toggled on and off. Twigs can also be overlayed. Band pass filter can be applied to traces by inputting a hi and lo pass frequency. Cursors can be dragged along the trace to get T-picks.
